<center><h1>JUDO UNIFORM (A blue judogi (left) and a white judogi (right) (Mizuno Corporation)</h1></center>
<center><h2>A judogi (judo uniform) consists of a joi (top), shitabaki (pants), and an obi (belt). One competitor wears a white uniform, the other wears blue. Traditionally, both competitors wore white, but in 1997 the International Judo Federation officially decided to use blue judogi.</h2></center><br>
<center><h2>This coloring makes it easier for spectators to distinguish the competitors. It also makes it easy to distinguish competitors during katame-waza (grappling techniques). Blue judo uniforms were first used at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and colored judo uniforms have become the standard at the World Championships and other major tournaments.</h2></center>
