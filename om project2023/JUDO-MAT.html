<center><h1>Judo Mat</h1></center>
<h2>
Judo mats are a type of mat designed specifically for the martial art of judo. Judo is a combat sport that involves throws and takedowns, and as such, it is important to have a mat that can provide a safe and cushioned surface to fall on. </h2>
<center><h2> Judo Mats are usually made from a foam material, which helps to absorb the impact of falls and throws. Judo mats are available in a variety of sizes, thicknesses, textures and colours allowing you to find a mat that suits your needs and your aesthetic preferences.</h2></center>
