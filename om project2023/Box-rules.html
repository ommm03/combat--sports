   <ul>
  <li>  <h2> No groin-area strikes that would be extremely painful.

</li> </h2>
<h2><li>The player cannot be held while being punched.</li></h2>
      <h2><li>There should be no shoving, tripping, biting, or spitting on the opposing player.

</li></h2> 
       
       <h2><li>No headbutting, kicking, or striking with any portion of the arm other than the closed knuckles of the fist is permitted.</li></h2>
       
       <h2><li>The player must take care not to duck below their opponent's belt or grip the ropes while punching them. The distance between the two players is not taken into account in this scenario.</li></h2>
 
 
 <h2><li>Each player must take a full step back before they are permitted to punch again if the referee breaks a player's clinch.</li></h2>
 
 
 <h2><li>A player who has been knocked down must move to a neutral corner of the ring and wait for the referee's further instructions.</li></h2>
 
 
 <h2><li>The referee will foul you if you don't follow these guidelines. Depending on the foul, the player who committed it can receive a warning and have points taken away.</li></h2>
 
 
 <h2><li>If the foul is severe, it may also result in a straightforward disqualification. A player is eliminated if they purposefully commit a foul that prevents the battle from continuing. A player will be allowed an additional 5 minutes to recover if they unintentionally land a low blow.

</li></h2>
 
 <h2><li>A knockout occurs if the player is still unable to recover and carry on with the fight.</li></h2>
 
 <h2><li>If one of the participants sustains a fatal injury as a result of a foul, the fight is declared no contest. The second option is to determine the result of the fight based on how many rounds each player has engaged in.

</li></h2>
