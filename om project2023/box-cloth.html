They hold an important function, whether that’s to give your body the support it needs with tights, shorts, or socks, or it is some custom clothing to represent your club.

<h1>Boxing robe</h1>
<h2>The real purpose of a boxing robe or boxing gown is to keep the fighter and their muscles warm during their walkouts. It is extremely common for fighters to warm up before a fight by hitting pads or skipping as it helps them to get their muscles warmed up and loose.</h2><br><br><br>

<h1>Fight trunks</h1>
<h2>Every fighter knows that their trunks can say a lot about them. It can be their team colors; it may represent where they come from or can be used to symbolize their individuality. This is why having options, a variety of colors, cuts, and styles are so important. Some fighters prefer shorter, more traditional lengths because they like unrestricted freedom of movement. While others may like the coverage and comfort of a longer, contemporary cut. Female fighters may also prefer trunks that are made to, specifically, fit their bodies more naturally. All things considered; it just gives another meaning to the timeless boxing expression that “styles make fights.”</h2>
