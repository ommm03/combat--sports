What are Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Mats?
</h1></center>
       
    <h2>Brazilian jiu-jitsu or BJJ MATS, also known as tatami or folding mats, are essential to any martial arts gym.  They provide a safe place to practice takedowns and throws for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners. Not only do BJJ mats provide a cushion during training sessions, but they also protect gym floors from scratches and tears due to the intense activity found in gyms.</h2><br>

       <li><h2>Folding mats are great if you're travelling or you don't want to use all the time.  These can be quite costly and you require adequate storage.</h2></li> 
        
        
    <li><h2>Smooth mats are great for doing partner drills.</h2></li> 
   
   
    <li><h2>Puzzle mats offer more of a traditional training feel and a simple to install with the <u>interlocking design.</u></h2></li>
