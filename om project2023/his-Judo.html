<center><h1> Kano Jigoro - The Founder of Judo</center></h1>
<h2>Judo is a martial art that was born in Japan, and it is now known around the world as an Olympic sport. Judo was created in 1882 by combining jujutsu, a form of close combat, with elements of mental discipline.</h2>
<h2>The era of samurai rule came to an end with the Meiji Restoration of 1868, when Japan modernized from the Edo period to the Meiji period (1868â€“1912) and Western culture began working its way into Japanese society. Jujutsu fell into decline, but the enthusiasm of one young man rescued it from extinction. That man was Kano Jigoro, the founder of judo as we know it today. Jigoro excelled in schoolwork but had an inferiority complex about his small physique, so he became an apprentice of Fukuda Hachinosuke, a master of the Tenjin Shinyo-ryu style of jujutsu, when he was 17 and worked to become stronger. In May 1882, he took the best elements of each jujutsu style and combined them into a single new school. He was only 21 years old at the time. This was the birth of modern judo. At first, he had just nine students. The dojo (practice hall) he opened at a temple measured just 12 jo (1 jo is around 1.5 square meters or 16 square feet).</h2>
