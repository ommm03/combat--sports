  <center><h1>Muay Thai Rules</h1></center>
  
  <ul>
      <li><h2>Muay Thai matches take place in a ring between 6.1m x 6.1m and 7.3m x 7.3m.

</h2></li>
      <li><h2>Competitors competing in a professional match should be over the age of 15 and their weight should be in the same weight category and not more than 5 pounds difference in weight.</h2></li>
      <li><h2>Before every Thai Boxing match, each boxer is required to pay homage in accordance with the heritage of Muay Thai. This involves a ritual dance accompanied by music played by a Javanese tom-tom drum, a Javanese oboe and and a small pair of cymbals.</h2></li>
      <li><h2>Once homeage has been completed, the bout is ready to begin and both fighters must shake hands before the bout begins to agree that they will compete in accordance with the rules and in a sportsmanlike manner.</h2></li>
     <li><h2>Muay Thai bouts have 5 rounds each of 3 minutes each, with a two minute rest period between each.</h2></li>
 <li><h2>Once the bout begins, both fighters attempt to win the match by utilising their fists, feet, elbows, knees and shins in an attempt to defeat their opponent.</h2></li>
 
 <li><h2>The fight is won once one fighter knocks out their opponent, the referee stops the fight because they deem one fighter unfit to carry on or the fight goes the full distance and one fighter is declared the winner on points. Should the points totals be equal then the match is declared a draw.</h2></li>
  </ul>
