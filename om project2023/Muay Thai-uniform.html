  <center><h4>There is no uniform for Muay Thai, unlike other martial arts like Judo, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Karate. Other than a pair of boxing gloves, there is no rule for attire when it comes to training Muay Thai. However, Muay Thai shorts are typically mandated for all Muay Thai competitions.<br><br>

Muay Thai training is also done barefooted on gym mats. Shoes are only required for runs which professional Thai fighters partake in daily as a warm-up before actual training.

<center><h1>Muay Thai Shorts</h1></center>
<center><h2>As mentioned, Muay Thai athletes compete in Muay Thai shorts and most of them also wear them during training.<br><br> 

Besides the connection to boxing shorts, Muay Thai shorts offer freedom of movement and breathable comfort which make them suitable for the kickboxing sport. <br><br>

As more and more people take up Muay Thai outside of Thailand, Muay Thai shorts have gained popularity in fight gyms around the world. Muay Thai shorts are relatively affordable and come in a wide variety of designs. <br><br>

<center><h1>Muay Thai T-Shirts</h1></center>
<center><h2>As mentioned earlier, men often choose to train topless in Muay Thai. This is due to the high intensity of the sport as well as the heat in Thailand. Outside of Thailand, men may choose to go with a tank top or t-shirt when training in the gym. <br><br>

Female Muay Thai practitioners may choose to wear tank tops, t-shirts or sports bras to pair with Muay Thai shorts. Sports leggings and compression shorts are also common for women.

Muay Thai t-shirts may come in cotton or quick-dry polyester fabric with the latter more suitable for training. Muay Thai t-shirts are versatile in that they can be worn for exercise or casual occasions. </h2></center><br><br>

<center><h1>Ankle Guard</h1></center>
<center><h2>Ankle guards help to keep the ankle joints warm and stable, helping to lower the risks of injuries. They are not mandatory in competitions or training but are favored by many professional athletes. 

Ankle guards are very affordable and the benefits are multifold. The support they provide makes them a cheap and worthwhile investment.</h2></center>
