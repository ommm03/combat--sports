<h2>However, traditional Muay Thai ring that was use in the past was a bit different form the one that being used today, in terms of equipment used and the place (direction) where each column is placed. That is the red corner placed in the north-west, the blue corner in the south-east. However, it is still strong believes in terms of ritual and the Muay Thai ring. For example there are traditional way and practice before boxers enter to the ring, they must crouch down on the canvas. There is also a strict rule of women not to enter to the Muay Thai ring, which is believed that they will conflict with the amulets. However, in the modern era, the Muay Thai tradition has changed to accept women to become Muay Thai boxer and they are able to entering the Muay Thai ring, but there must be separate arena only for women and they are still not allowed to jump over the top rope to entering the ring which will represent that they are over the men boxers and their amulets, instead they have to duck under the rope to enter the ring</h2></center>
