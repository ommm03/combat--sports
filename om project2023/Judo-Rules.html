    <h2>Judo was initially being used as a self-defence technique involving much deadly practice. Later, it has been modified for safe practice among the students. So International Judo Federation added many rules to make it safe.</h2>
   <center> <h1>Judo Rules On Safety</h1> </center>
   <center><h2>The rules regarding safety in Judo are as follows</h2></center>
 <ul><h2>
   
  <li>Intentionally harming an opponent is abandoned.

</li>
  
  <li>One cannot punch or kick his opponent.</li>
  <li>You cannot touch the opponent’s face.</li>
  <li>Attacking the joints other than elbows is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Head dives are also not permitted.</li>
  <li>Some techniques like Kawazu gake and Kami basami are not allowed.</li>
  
  <li>Neither of the competitors is allowed to wear any hard metallic object during the competition.</li>
   </h2>
   </ul>  
  <center> <h1>Penalties in Judo</h1></center> 
   <center><h2>Generally, two types of penalties are there in Judo. One is shido and another is hansoku. Shido is awarded when a competitor remains in longer period of nonaggression. It is also awarded for minor rule breach. After two warnings, one shido is awarded. Number of shidos decides the winner in case the match ends in tie.

On the other hand, four shidos will make one hansoku. Hansoku is also awarded for major rule violation. There may be a chance that he/she may get disqualified from the tournament.
