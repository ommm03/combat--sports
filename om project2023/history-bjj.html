 <center>   <h1>1400-1800s: Japanese Samurai Build upon Jiu Jutsu</h1></center>

<h2> The roots of all modern martial arts can be traced back thousands of years to Buddhist monks in southwest India, from where they spread to China, Okinawa and mainland Japan. The story of modern jiu jitsu, however, starts on feudal Japan's battlefields. It is believed that jiu jitsu was initially developed as the fighting art of the samurai. The samurai were heavily armed and armoured on horseback. Their armour restricted their movements significantly and made the martial arts used in neighbouring Okinawa and China that mainly utilised striking techniques ineffective. A system of fighting that focused more on throws, joint locks and chokes was developed to make it possible for the samurai to defend themselves and fight effectively if they found themselves disarmed and on foot. The oldest recorded style of formally taught jiu jitsu is Shinden Fudo-Ryu, founded around 1130 CE by Ganpachiro Temeyoshi.</h2><br>
<h2>Jiu jitsu would evolve further in the 17th century during the Tokugawa shogunate when laws influenced by neo-Confucianism were imposed to reduce war. The civil wars of the Sengoku period ended, and a new era of stability arose. Unarmed combat became more popular during this period, and the practice of jiu jitsu became more widespread throughout society. By the early-1800s, there were hundreds and possibly even thousands of different schools of jiu jitsu, each with its own unique flavour and style, being taught in Japan.</h2>
