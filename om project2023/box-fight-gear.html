    <h1>Boxing Gloves:-</h1>
    <h2>The design of boxing gloves is straightforward and efficient, providing protection for both the puncher and the target of the blow. By prolonging each hit and dispersing the force of impact over a larger area than a naked fist would, boxing gloves lessen the force of blows. The more force is absorbed by the puncher's hands and the opponent's head, the smaller the glove.</h2><br><br>

     <h1>Mouth guard:-</h1>
    <h2>Athletes who play contact sports will require mouth guards to prevent knocked-out teeth, loose teeth, broken teeth, and other traumatic dental injuries. Contact sports include Mma, boxing,etc.</h2><br><br><br>

    <h1>Ring shoes</h1>
    <h2>One of the primary benefits of wearing boxing shoes is that they are designed to provide you with better traction on the mat. This means that you’ll be able to move around the ring more quickly and easily, and you’ll be able to pivot and change directions more quickly. Additionally, boxing shoes are typically lighter than regular shoes, which can make it easier to move around and conserve energy during a fight</h2><br><br><br>

   <h1>Wraps or Gauze</h1> 
   <h2>Hand wrapping also protects the tendons, muscles and cushions the impact of the wrist. The second purpose of the hand wrap is to keep the loose or moving joints in place. It provides restriction for these joints, so the shock is absorbed and redistributed across the entire hand.</h2>
