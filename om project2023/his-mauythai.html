<h2> <center> 
The history of Muay Thai can be traced historically to the Sukhothai dynasty of Thailand around the 13th century. As recorded in Thai history, the first Thai army was born out of a need to defend the kingdom and soldiers were taught both armed and unarmed combat. Over time, the evolution of this martial art gave us Muay Boran and Muay Thai as we know it today.<br><br><br>

Due to wars with neighboring kingdoms and tribes over the centuries, Muay Thai became a way of life for the people of Siam (as Thailand used to be called). One of the most famous stories of Muay Thai came via the great Nai Khanom Tom, during the Ayutthaya period. The tale narrates how Nai Khanom Tom defeated 9 Burmese fighters, one after another, during his imprisonment after the Siam kingdom was under siege. The historical event (half steeped in myth) is now celebrated as Muay Thai day which takes place every year on March 17th.<br><br><br>

During the Rattanakosin Kingdom era (around 18th-early 20th century), Muay Thai was formally became a national sport where rules and regulations were introduced.

<center><h1>Modern Muay Thai</h1></center>

<center><h2>Muay Thai has grown over years since around World War I period to become a combat sport loved and practised all around the world. Modern Muay Thai encompasses elements of traditional boxing including the use of padded boxing gloves, 3 to 5 rounds with time limit, defined rules and take place within a ring (squared platform).<br><br><br>

Muay Thai takes much of its strikes and techniques from ancient Muay Thai, also commonly known as Muay Boran. Muay Boran was created primarily for hand-to-hand combat during warfare. As the sport evolves, dangerous techniques from Muay Boran that may be deadly have become forbidden in Muay Thai such as strikes to the joints or back of the head.<br><br><br>

Other than variations of punches as seen in western boxing (e.g. jabs, crosses, hooks, uppercuts), kicks, elbows and knee strikes are used in Muay Thai. Clinching, sweeps and throws are also used strategically in modern Muay Thai to make it an all-rounded combat art. Due to the 8-point contact, the sport has proven to be one of the most effective stand-up striking art and practised by many mixed martial artists.<br><br><br>

The stadiums of Lumpinee and Rajadamnern in Bangkok are considered to be the most prestigious arenas of Muay Thai. Fighters, local and foreign aspire to compete at the stadiums.
