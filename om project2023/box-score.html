  <h2>The modern boxing scoring system is known as the '10-Point Must System'. Here is a basic overview of how it works:</h2>
  
  <ul>
      <h2><li>Judges score each round individually, on a 10-point scale. Most rounds are scored 10-9, with the boxer who did better scoring 10 and 'winning' the round, with the other fighter scoring 9.

</li></h2>
      
      
      <h2><li>If a boxer is knocked down or hurt enough to prompt a standing count from the referee, that fighter loses a point. So, if a boxer dominates a round, controlling and landing better punches throughout and also knocks their opponent down, the end result is a 10-8 round.</li></h2>
      
      
      <h2><li>If both fighters score a knockdown in the same round, the deductions 'cancel each other out (so it would probably still be a 10-9 round in favour of the better boxer)</li></h2>
      
      
      <h2><li>A judge is able to award a 10-8 round without a knockdown, if the fighter scoring 10 dominated the round by a huge margin (this is usually only used if a round is total one-way traffic, or perhaps if a fighter was saved from a knockdown because the round expired).

</li></h2>
      
      
  
  <h2><li>Judges are also able to award a 10-10 round, if the round in their eyes was completely even and there was nothing between the fighters.</li></h2>
  
  
  
  
  </ul>
