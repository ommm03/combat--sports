    <h2> Boxing rings are regulated spaces used for amateur and professional boxing matches. Originally earning the ‘ring’ name from early boxing contests performed within casually drawn circular zones, boxing rings today are now square in shape—leading to boxing rings commonly being referred to as ‘squared circles.’ Boxing rings consist of a raised platform within which an inner boxing space is shaped by ropes pulled between poles located at each corner. The surface of a boxing ring is covered in a layer of roughly 1” (25 mm) thick padding and covered with a stretched canvas. Each boxer and team is located on opposite corners of the boxing ring at either the blue or red corner.<br><br>
    Boxing rings have an overall width of 25’7” (280 cm) with an inner space between the ropes of 20’ (610 cm). A perimeter space of 33.5” (85 cm) is provided outside the ropes. A standard boxing ring with a 20’ (610 cm) interior space has an overall area of 655 ft2 (60.9 m2).
